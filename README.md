# 📄 Image → PDF & PDF → OCR Converter

**"Simple Image & PDF → OCR converter that works in Google Colab, no coding needed."**

## ✨ About This Project

I don’t know coding at all — this started when I was just trying to upload a PDF to ChatGPT, but it wouldn’t work.
After some digging, I realized the issue was that my PDF wasn’t OCR-enabled (meaning the text couldn’t be read, only images).

I tried a bunch of online converters, but most of them were either **too slow, limited, or asked me to sign up**. That’s when I decided to make my own solution.

Since I don’t know how to code, I asked **ChatGPT** to help me. It wrote the complete code, and I just followed the steps.
Now, anyone can use this simple tool for:

* 🖼️ Converting **Images → PDF**
* 📄 Converting **PDF → Searchable OCR PDF**
* ⚡ Running directly in **Google Colab** (no setup, no installation)
* 📱 Working on **PC & Mobile**
